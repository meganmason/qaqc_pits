# Weather,"Deep snowpack, clouds breaking briefly, light snow. IB: Snow accumulation exceeded the size of the SWE tube. Depth and density measurements were taken with the 1000cc wedge cutter. HN = 90cm, but density was only measured for 80cm of the new snow profile, so SWE calculations are only for 80cm of new snow on board."
