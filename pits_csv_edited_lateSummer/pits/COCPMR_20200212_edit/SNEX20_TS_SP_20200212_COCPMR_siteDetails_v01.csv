# Weather,"Overcast, Temperature dropping with fading sun, light snow, -12C, wind picking up. IB: There was too much accumulation to measure with provided SWE tube, so measurements were taken with a large wedge cutter."

# Comments:,"Used small wedge cutter (1/4L) from 51-11cm snow depths due to
unconsolidation and vegetation encroachment. Additionally, willow
shrubs prevented sampling at 11-1cm.  Storm board measurements
performed similar to snow pit with wedge cutter due to accumulation
significantly greater than height of provided SWE tube - hence only
one depth and SWE measurement"
